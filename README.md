# 👋 Hi, I’m Angela Elenchevska

- 👀 I’m interested in Data, Marketing, and everything in between!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code and work with databases, focusing on SQL and data analysis.
- 💼 By day, I work on marketing campaigns. By night, I'm a data enthusiast exploring new trends and technologies.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exciting data-driven projects, marketing analytics, and innovative solutions that bridge the gap between data and marketing. 
- 📫 You can reach me via: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elenchevska1211) or [Email](angelaelenchevska@gmail.com).
  
- 📚 When I’m not diving into data, you can find me 🎶 attending music events at beautiful venues with my dearest friends or 💪 hitting the gym.  
- ✨ Constantly pursuing the finer things in life, whether it’s 🍽️ enjoying gourmet cuisine, 👗 discovering exquisite fashion, or ✈️ experiencing luxurious travel destinations.
